👤 Face Recognition Attendance System (Python Mini Project)
📌 Project Description

The Face Recognition Attendance System is a Python-based mini project that uses computer vision to recognize a person’s face through a webcam and automatically mark their attendance in a CSV file with date and time.

The system compares real-time facial data with a pre-stored image and records attendance when a match is found.

🎯 Objectives

Detect and recognize faces using a webcam

Mark attendance automatically

Store attendance records with date and time

Learn practical use of Python in AI and Computer Vision

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

Python 3

OpenCV (cv2) – webcam access & display

face_recognition – face detection & recognition

NumPy – numerical operations

CSV – attendance file handling

Datetime – date & time tracking
